## 💡 Key Talking Points

*   **You don't replace them**: The AI handles the "chore" of initial data gathering.
*   **You don't commoditize them**: We protect their margins and highlight their value.
*   **Better Clients**: We send "Qualified Demand" (high budget, serious intent), not tire-kickers.
*   **Scale**: This allows DMCs to handle more volume without adding more staff for basic inquiries.

## 🛠️ Configuration

*   **Branding**: The site is fully branded as **Privé International**.
*   **Powered By**: The chatbot is labeled as **"Powered by PRV8"**.
